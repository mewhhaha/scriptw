## React Server Components


Measured **2026-11-03** with pinned React 19.3.1 and one retained module per
process. Both sync and async Flight outputs match Node exactly.

| Engine | Sync · ms | Async · ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Scriptw platform baseline | 28.827 | 31.844 |
| Scriptw candidate | 23.372 | 26.186 |
| Node 24.12.0 / V8 | 0.476 | 0.393 |

![Matched retained RSC request timings](assets/rsc-current/runtime.svg)

Each engine uses eight fresh processes across two balanced blocks, with three
checked warmups and seven measured requests per mode. Scriptw's request clock
covers the retained call through full Flight consumption; Node uses the same
bundle and wrapper in one `vm.SourceTextModule`/Realm for sync then async. JSON
encoding and exact-output checks follow the clock. Candidate medians are 18.9%
and 17.8% below baseline; this combines captured-cell and timer-owner changes,
so it does not isolate either change or claim engine parity.

Runtime ABI 47 adds bounded `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, byte `ReadableStream`
sources with default readers, events, abort signals, `DOMException`, microtasks
and timers. This is not full Web API or WHATWG Streams conformance;
Fetch/Request/URL integration and DOM nodes remain unsupported.

Cold phase medians are similar: source-to-Wasm is 3.629 s / 3.625 s and native
preparation 12.464 s / 12.524 s (baseline / candidate). Program Wasm grows 1.36%,
from 7,551,136 to 7,653,675 bytes; no cold-preparation improvement is claimed.

## Runtime comparison

**Measured 2026-11-02 locally**, compiler fingerprint `87385fff34d1`.
V8 **13.6.233.17-node.37**, Node **24.12.0**.
Scriptw is faster than Scriptc in **17/17 workloads** in both blocks; block execution geometric means are **0.455–0.458× Scriptc**. Scriptw is faster than V8 in **6/17 workloads** in both blocks; block execution geometric means are **1.098–1.106× V8**.

This compares Wasm public entry with V8 `runInContext`. Scriptw and Scriptc compile
Wasm before the measured processes and share a Wasmtime host with compilation disabled.
Wasmtime 47.0.0 uses size-optimized/backtracking
native code and a generic target.
Timed Wasm entry includes Scriptw Realm/intrinsic bootstrap. V8 parses one `vm.Script`
per process and creates a fresh `vm.Context` before each invocation outside entry timing;
lazy compilation, JIT tiering and natural GC may occur inside. Every entry checks output.

Each bar shows the median of eight process medians: four processes per balanced
block, each with 21 measured entries after ten checked warmups. Memory bars show
median GNU-time whole-child **peak RSS** for all three runtimes, including host,
code, runtime and warmup history. Warmups do not establish optimized steady state.
Each panel uses its own zero-based scale. Chart data also retains V8 context-creation
time as a supplemental measurement, excluded from bars and ratios.

## Application workloads

Measured **2026-11-02**, compiler `87385fff34d1`.
Six synchronous request/response kernels use plain records, without networking or
Web APIs. The seventh case bundles real React 19.3.1
legacy `renderToString` with hooks/context and 32 escaped rows.
Times cover complete batches: 64 requests for JSON/routing/query/middleware,
32 HTML requests, 48 nested-result requests, or one 32-row SSR render.

Two balanced blocks, eight fresh processes per available actor/case; each process
has seven measured entries after three checked warmups. Cards show the median of
process entry medians and median whole-child peak RSS. Wasm compilation/loading
and V8 source/context setup stay outside entry timing; Scriptw Realm bootstrap
stays inside. Failed actors have no timing or memory bar.

Across the **5 completed Scriptc comparisons**, Scriptw batch medians
are **3.8–9.3× Scriptc**. Failed cases receive no speed score.

Real Server Components separately serialize and consume Flight streams in Node,
including an async component. Web references use Node's Request/Response/URL APIs.
The browser cases use real React DOM in Chromium: mount, state update and hydration,
with commit plus forced layout timed in the page. RSC renders 32 rows, Web API
cases process 32 requests, and client cases render 64 rows. Setup and golden-output comparisons are
outside these timers. These host references have different timing boundaries;
they establish no engine parity. Browser RSS covers all three cases in one process
and is not assigned to individual cases.

![Node Flight and Web API references](assets/applications-current/react-server.svg)
![Chromium React DOM references](assets/applications-current/react-browser.svg)

| Reference | Entry median · ms |
| --- | ---: |
| RSC Flight · sync | 0.505 |
| RSC Flight · async | 0.571 |
| URL / Request | 2.016 |
| JSON / Request | 3.797 |
| React mount | 1.137 |
| React update | 1.347 |
| React hydration | 1.945 |

Actual standalone build/execution attempts remain visible, including failures:

| Capability attempt | Scriptw | Scriptc | V8 host reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RSC Flight · sync | Execution failed | Build failed | Node checked |
| RSC Flight · async | Execution failed | Build failed | Node checked |
| URL / Request | Execution failed | Build failed | Node checked |
| JSON / Request | Execution failed | Build failed | Node checked |
| React client mount | Timed out (60 s) | Build failed | Chromium checked |

Standalone run timeouts include compilation and startup; they do not isolate
rendering time. Scriptw's portable build and ordinary NativeHost run are
separate probes; the run recompiles source instead of loading the dumped pair.
At this frozen benchmark revision, Scriptw lacked DOM, encoding, Web Streams,
Fetch and URL APIs, as recorded by its capability probe. Current-source RSC
measurements are reported in the [README](../../README.md#benchmarks).

The frozen [failure diagnosis](applications-current.json) records
missing `TextEncoder` during RSC initialization. Corrected Scriptc Web probes
reach `SC3002` (WASI API admission), and its nested-result case reports `SC2020`
(dynamic `Array.slice` end unsupported). React bundles retain type-check errors.
Scriptw's SSR output has a 2-MB function, triggering size-optimized native
compilation; a debugger sample finds Cranelift optimization active at 20 seconds.

## Compilation time


**JavaScript → portable Wasm**, measured 2026-11-02 with the same compiler
fingerprint as the runtime charts. Scriptw is faster in **17/17 workloads**,
taking **0.524x Scriptc's time** by geometric mean of workload medians.

![JavaScript to portable Wasm compilation time](assets/compilation-current.svg)

Four fresh CLI builds per compiler/workload across two balanced blocks
(**136 processes**). Includes startup and output I/O: Scriptw P plus its shared R
sidecar; Scriptc standalone WASI. Application caches are fresh; OS and Zig toolchain
caches remain. Runtime production, Wasm-to-native compilation and execution are
excluded. [Data and tool identities](compilation-current.json) ·

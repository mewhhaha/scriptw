//! Which dispatch `emit_method_call` *selects* for an `Iterator.prototype`
//! helper, asserted on the emitted module rather than on program output.
//!
//! # Why output tests cannot ask this question
//!
//! Every other test of this family — the fourteen in
//! `scriptw-cli/tests/cli/iterator_helpers.rs` and the four in `iterator.rs` —
//! runs a fixture and reads its stdout. That is the right shape for "is the
//! answer correct", and it is structurally unable to answer "which arm handled
//! the call", because a correct dispatch and a correct fall-through are
//! supposed to produce the same output. The batch-5 differential fixture says
//! so in its own doc comment.
//!
//! It mattered, and not hypothetically. The defect those fixtures were written
//! for was a selection failure. `new S()`, for a class with heritage and no
//! explicit constructor, is lowered with `kind = Undefined` and a nullish
//! `possible_kinds`; `receiver_shape_targets_iterator_helper` is therefore
//! false, seven of the helper blocks declined the call, and the generic tail
//! took its statically-nullish shortcut and returned having emitted **no call
//! at all**. The runtime value is an ordinary object, so the emitted nullish
//! test never fired and the caller read stale scratch. `drop` and `flatMap`
//! carry an extra `!receiver_is_array` disjunct and were dispatched correctly
//! throughout, which is the only reason their fixtures were green.
//!
//! # The oracle, and the measurement it is calibrated against
//!
//! `drop` and `flatMap`. Each test builds two programs that differ in exactly
//! one identifier and compares the emitted `scriptw::main` bodies.
//!
//! Measured on the pre-repair compiler with `SCRIPTW_EMIT_SIZE_REPORT_PATH`
//! over the minimal pair (`new Source().drop(1);` against
//! `new Source().take(1);`): `scriptw::main` is **557,233** bytes for `drop`
//! and **557,156** for `take` — the failing helper emits **77 bytes fewer**,
//! which is the whole of the call it did not emit. That is the signal, and it
//! is an order of magnitude above [`PAYLOAD_ENCODING_SLACK`].
//!
//! [`PRELUDE`] is what makes the comparison fair. It calls all four helpers
//! under test on a *helper-shaped* receiver, whose static shape does resolve
//! them, so both programs root and emit the same set of builtins and take the
//! same fast path for those calls; only the statement under test differs.
//!
//! # What this does not claim, and the control that keeps it from being vacuous
//!
//! It is a *differential*, not a fingerprint. It cannot name the emitter that
//! ran, only that two calls were emitted alike, and it would stay green if a
//! future change routed both members of a pair into the generic tail. `drop` and
//! `flatMap` on this receiver are covered end to end by their own CLI fixtures,
//! so "drop is correct" plus "take is emitted like drop" is a real chain. Rung G
//! is the tool for absolute claims about emitted bytes and is deliberately
//! inapplicable to a change that is meant to move them.
//!
//! That residual is larger than the paragraph above used to admit, and saying
//! "a future change" hid it. **At this head the two `_dispatches_..._like_...`
//! tests cannot fail**, because both guards funnel a non-array receiver into the
//! same emitter: `take`/`map` reach it through
//! `receiver_shape_targets_iterator_helper` while lowering is right, and through
//! `receiver_needs_dynamic_helper_dispatch` when it is wrong (a nullish-typed
//! receiver is inside that predicate's kind set), and `drop`/`flatMap` reach it
//! unconditionally on any non-array receiver. Under every configuration
//! reachable from here the difference is bounded by construction rather than by
//! measurement.
//!
//! [`iterator_helper_dispatch_differential_separates_two_emitters`] is what
//! stops that from being the whole story. It runs the identical comparison over
//! two statements that genuinely reach different emitters and asserts the
//! difference is **larger** than the slack. Without it, `assert_dispatched_alike`
//! is an instrument nobody has shown can move.
//!
//! # Routing since the intrinsic-method gate
//!
//! Lowering now emits the helper `CallMethod` only for a receiver whose shape
//! names the `%Iterator.prototype%` builtin while that prototype provably still
//! holds it. Every other receiver — this nullish-typed class receiver included,
//! and `drop`/`flatMap` exactly like `take`/`map` — is lowered as an ordinary
//! property read and call, because the name alone does not say which function
//! the program installed. Both members of each pair therefore reach the same
//! generic emitter, and the pairs now guard against either name regaining a
//! name-based route of its own.
